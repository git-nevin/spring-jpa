@Entity
public class Employee {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private long id;

    private String name;

    private int age;

    @ManyToOne
    private Department department;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "employee")
    private List<Phone> phones;

    // getters and setters...
}





Each Employee will be assigned to only one Department:

@Entity
public class Department {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private long id;

    private String name;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")
    private List<Employee> employees;

    // getters and setters...
}

Lastly, each Employee will have multiple Phones:

@Entity
public class Phone {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private long id;

    private String number;

    @ManyToOne
    private Employee employee;

    // getters and setters...
}
